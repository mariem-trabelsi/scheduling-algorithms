# Scheduling-algorithms
Refers to a collection of algorithms written in the C programming language that are designed to manage and optimize the execution order of tasks or processes in a computer system.

These algorithms play a crucial role in operating systems and multitasking environments, determining the sequence in which tasks are executed on a CPU.

The term encompasses a variety of scheduling algorithms, including but not limited to:

## First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):
Tasks are executed in the order they arrive.

## Shortest Job First (SJF):
The task with the shortest total processing time is granted priority.

## Shortest Remaining Time (SRT): 
The task with the shortest remaining processing time is given priority.

## Dynamic Priority Scheduling: 
Priority levels of tasks are adjusted dynamically based on factors such as waiting time or resource requirements.
